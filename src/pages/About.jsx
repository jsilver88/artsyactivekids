            Hi there! I’m Danielle, Sophie’s mommy. I have a degree in visual
            communications from FIDM and have been teaching kids and toddlers
            art since 2018.

            Art has always been a creative fun space for me to let my mind run
            wild and creating without an end result is the way my studio based
            classes are offered.{" "}

            My process art and sensory based studio is here for your kids to
            explore, enjoy and more importantly find their own creative way of
            expressing themselves through art.{" "}
